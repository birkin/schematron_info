Overview
========

- a way of validating xml; assertion-based; familiar to [TDD-ers] [TDD].

- from [wikipedia] [WIK]: _"...Schematron is a rule-based validation language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML trees. It is a structural schema language expressed in XML using a small number of elements and XPath."_

- wonderful [introduction] [INT] (**especially** the section 'Schematron hierarchy'), and the full article includes information about how schematron complements other xml schemas
  - 'assertions' define conditions to test
  - 'rules' define the context, or where in the document to apply the conditions

- hands on tutorial, [ibm developerworks] [IBM]

- concise [schematron test examples] [EXA], showing, for each example, the schematron test xml, minimalist source xml that passes and fails and expected test output.

- [schematron validation with lxml] [LXM], a popular python xml library
